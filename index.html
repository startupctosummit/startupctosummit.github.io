        <h3>Welcome to the Startup CTO Summit Series</h3>

<p>The Startup Summit CTO Series was created to allow CTO’s and engineering leaders to learn from and connect with their peers. It’s not hard to find a gathering of technologists debating front end frameworks, containerization or the relative benefits of Scala, Clojure and Go. Finding a group of geeks talking about the hard parts of building a successful engineering team like hiring, developing an engineering culture and managing (your team and your boss) is more challenging.</p>

<p>My name’s Peter Bell. I used to run engineering for a number of startups in New York - including General Assembly. In March of this year I organized a startup CTO summit in NYC. I thought 20 friends would show up. We ended up selling out the venue, with 110 engineering leaders and with presentations from the CTO’s of companies including Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, Tumblr, Birchbox, Warby Parker and Art.sy <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/startup-cto-summit-tickets-10478392153">http://www.eventbrite.com/e/startup-cto-summit-tickets-10478392153</a>".</p>


<p>This fall, we’re running conferences in San Francisco, Washington DC, New York, Boston, Sydney and Melbourne. Attendance to the event is strictly limited to engineering leaders. No recruiters, non-technical co-founders or other business stakeholders will be allowed (we enforce this policy strictly and will refund tickets of anyone we can’t admit). That said, we’re not hung up on job titles. Some of our best attendees have titles like CEO or VP Product. As long as you can perform a technical code review, know how to submit a pull request and are interested in better hiring, managing and organizing developers, we can’t wait to meet you!</p>
